A. Retrieve the names of all employees in Department 5 who work for more than 10 hours per week on the ProductX project. Do this in a single SQL statement and use the project name as a criterion.

B. Add two dependents for Alex Freed, fraternal twins named ‘Alexander’ and ‘Alexandra’, born on January 1, 1980. Use the relationships ‘Son’ and ‘Daughter’ respectively.

C.List the names of all employees who have a dependent whose name starts with the same first name as themselves. The parent’s name is the “stem” of the string pattern that your query will use to find dependents whose names match or start with the “stem”.

Example: Parent’s name is ‘Bob’. Dependent’s name is ‘Bobby’, which contains the stem

‘Bob’. So the query results should include the employee Bob.

D.Delete the two rows inserted in step (b). Be sure to delete only those rows.

E. Find the names of all employees who are directly supervised by ‘Franklin Wong’. Do this

in a single SQL statement.
